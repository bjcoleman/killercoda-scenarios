## Make the Pull Request

Now that you have your change committed, you should `push`
the change to your repo (`origin`) and create a Pull Request.

NOTE: When you execute the `git push` command, `git` will prompt
you for a username and password.  You should provide your Github
username and a Github [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).

These values are **NOT** saved in the scenario virtual machine.

## Conflict!

When you create your Pull Request, you will notice that Github
gives a message, "Can’t automatically merge. Don’t worry, you
can still create the pull request."  This occurs because another
developer has made a change in the `README.md` while you were making
your correction of the typo.

The next step will walk you through the process of fixing the conflict.
