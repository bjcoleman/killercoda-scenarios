The goal of this scenario is to demonstrate how to resolve a conflict
in the Github workflow.

You will make a contribution to a repo while a simulated person makes a
different change.  These changes will conflict, and you will have to
resolve the conflict.

This scenario assumes that you have a [Github](https://github.com/) account.
If you do not, go to [github.com](https://github.com/) to sign up.
